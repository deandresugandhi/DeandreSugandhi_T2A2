## R1 - Identification of the problem you are trying to solve by building this particular app

The purpose of this app is to assist people trying to find and retrieve items they have lost, especially in establishments where this may occur more often, such as train stations, buses, printing stations / internet cafes (leaving USBs / other portable storage devices in the computers), supermarkets, and cinemas, as well as in 'unowned' spaces which may not have a dedicated lost-and-found facility, such as public roads, highways, sidewalks, bus stops, public toilets, some recreation areas, public markets, and open plazas.

This app will be designed so that it can be used flexibly as a solution to various problems. For example, it can be used as a tool for establishment to improve their own lost-and-found facilities, or maybe developed into an independent community website for items lost in unowned public spaces.

## R2 - Why is it a problem that needs solving?

While many places usually have dedicated lost-and-found facilities, where staffs keep reliable records of lost items and store them safely for people to retrieve later, based on my experience, people will usually need to contact these establishments through phone or email to find out if the items they have lost are there. This may be inefficient for both parties at times; for example, busy establishments and their staffs may take longer to respond to such emails, or to pick up such calls, only for the callers to possibly discover that their items are not there or that they may have misplaced their items elsewhere.

Furthermore, while dealing with people claiming their lost items may require more personal verification methods such phone calls or face-to-face meetings, dealing with people just trying to find out if their lost items are kept in an establishment's lost-and-found section does not necessarily require such verification measures; thus it can be argued that records of such items should be made more accessible, such as by displaying them in websites. Thus, this app can potentially eliminate unnecessary work for staffs who need to respond to inquiries on lost items which may not even be left there, and make it more convenient for people to trace their lost items.

Another problem this app can address is for items that are lost in 'unowned' spaces such as public roads, highways, sidewalks, bus stops, public toilets, some recreation areas, public markets, open plazas, etc., which may not have dedicated lost-and-found facilities. A person finding someone else's possibly misplaced items in such places, especially ones with no identifications, may not be sure what to do with them. For example, moving them to a safer, more hidden location can possibly cause more confusion for the owner of the items if they immediately retrace their steps and come back for it. Turning it in to a nearby establishment / local authorities can be similarly confusing for both parties especially if there are multiple establishments / authorities nearby. On the other hand, leaving them where they are leaves them open to thieves. This app can make it easier for these people to make a decision; they can make a post in the web app, noting which establishment they have turned these items to, or even their own contact information if they decide to hold the items temporarily for safekeeping.
